FilemanagerCapability

  Within the request-cycle of the filemanager there are two <get> commands. To determine which action is allowed 
  for a specific file, capabilities can be defined for each one. These capabilities are added to each response
  of a 'get-request'.
  
  The available capabilities are 'select', 'delete', 'rename', 'download'.
  
  There is a ready-to-go implementation: {{{./apidocs/codes/thischwa/c5c/requestcycle/impl/DefaultCapabiltiy.html}<<<codes.thischwa.c5c.requestcycle.impl.DefaultCapability>>>}},
  the default one. It just sends all capabilities defined in the property <connector.capabilities> for each file.
  
  If you want to change the capabilities for all <get> commands you just have to set the property <connector.capabilities> in your
  <<<c5connector.properties>>> file.
  
  If this doesn't meet your requirements, you have to implement your own one.
      
* Custom implementation

  Just implement the interface {{{./apidocs/codes/thischwa/c5c/requestcycle/FilemanagerCapability.html}<<<codes.thischwa.c5c.requestcycle.FilemanagerCapability>>>}}.
  Consult the javadoc and see how it works.
  
  And finally you have to declare your custom implementation in the <<<c5connector.properties>>> file:

+---+
connector.capabilities = <desired implementation>
